Mimirsbrunn (also called Mimir) is an independent geocoding and reverse-geocoding system written in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/), and built upon [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co). It
can handle addresses, streets, points-of-interest (POI), administrative regions and public transport
stops.

# What's a Geocoder ?

Usually [geocoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding) refers to "the process of transforming
a physical address description to a location on the Earth's surface". However Mimir is more a
[geoparser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toponym_resolution#Geoparsing) than a geocoder since it
can resolve any ambiguous toponym to its correct location.

In other words, a geocoder reads a description (possibly incomplete) of a location, and returns a
list of candidate locations (latitude / longitude) matching the input. 

Geocoding is traditionally used for autocompleting search fields used in geographic applications.
For example, here is a screenshot of Qwant Maps, where the user enters a search string `20 rue hec
mal`, and mimir returns possible candidates in a dropdown box.

# Getting Started

For an introduction to the project, you can have a look at the [Introduction to
Mimirsbrunn](docs/tutorials/introduction.md).


These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for
development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on deploying the project on a live
system.

## Prerequisites

Mimirsbrunn is a rust project, so you need to have a rust development environment. Instructions on
how to do that are found on the [rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Additionally, mimirsbrunn relies on [cosmogony](https://github.com/osm-without-borders/cosmogony) to
create so called cosmogony files which are used for indexing administrative regions.

For running end to end or unit tests, you need the docker engine available.

## Installing

You can install Mimirsbrunn from debian packages available as build artifacts on the repository
homepage. [FIXME Where are .deb ?]

You can also build Mimirsbrunn manually, as the following instructions explain.

You need to retrieve the project and build it using the rust compiler:

```
git clone https://github.com/CanalTP/mimirsbrunn.git
cd mimirsbrunn
cargo build --release
```

## Running

Having built the project, you can now perform a sanity check. This will serve as a test that the
program works, and as a basic example of the two main functionalities: indexing and querying.

So we'll index administrative regions into Elasticsearch, and then search for some of them. We'll
focus on one country, lets say... Denmark!

1. Download OSM file.

First we download the OSM file for Denmark, from the
[geofabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/denmark-latest.osm.pbf) server, and store the file
locally.

2. Generate cosmogony file.

If you haven't installed cosmogony yet, you need to do so now, by following the instructions
[here](https://github.com/osm-without-borders/cosmogony). You can then transform the original
OSM PBF file for Denmark (<p class="callout warning"> The following command must be typed in
the directory of the cosmogony project)

```
cargo run --release -- generate -i /path/to/denmark-latest.osm.pbf -o denmark.jsonl.gz
```

3. Start an Elasticsearch docker container.

We'll start an Elasticsearch version 7.13, available on ports 9200 and 9300.

```
docker run --name mimirsbrunn-test \
  -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -d docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.0
```

You can check that Elasticsearch has correctly started (maybe wait for about 10/20s for
Elasticsearch to be available):

```
curl 'http://localhost:9200'
{
  "name": "...",
  "cluster_name": "docker-cluster",
  ...
k  "tagline": "You Know, for Search"
}
```

4. Index cosmogony into Elasticsearch

The result of building the mimirsbrunn project includes several binaries located in
`/target/releases`, one of which is used to index cosmogony files:

cosmogony2mimir uses several configuration files found in the source code, and they work fine by
default. In the following command, we use a setting to make sure that cosmogony2mimir will target
the Elasticsearch container we just started: (See [here](/docs/indexings.md#cosmogony2mimir) for
more details about using cosmogony2mimir)

```
cd mimirsbrunn
./target/release/cosmogony2mimir \
  -c ./config \
  -m testing \
  -s elasticsearch.url='http://localhost:9200' \
  -s langs=['en', 'da'] \
  -i <path/to/denmark.jsonl.gz> \
  run
```

You can follow in the `mimirsbrunn/logs` directory.

5. Check Elasticsearch

The previous step created an index for administrative regions, and so you should be able to query your
Elasticsearch like so.

```
curl 'http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices'
```

6. Start Bragi

7. Query Bragi

## Testing

Since this is a rust project, we are well instrumented to run all sorts of tests:
* style
* lint
* unit tests
* end to end / integration.
* benchmark

You can run them all at once, and this in the way it is carried out in the CI pipeline, with 

```
make check
```

See this [page](/docs/testing.md) for a more in depth introduction to testing this project.

## Where to Go from There

Maybe you find that some the results you get are not ranked correctly, and want to adjust the way
Elasticsearch is configured. You can start by reading [this](/docs/process/elasticsearch.md)

# Development

You can find more developer oriented documentation [here](/docs/developer.md)

All those projects use quite the same APIs, and you can compare their results using
[geocoder-tester](https://github.com/geocoders/geocoder-tester).
